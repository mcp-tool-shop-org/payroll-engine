**Deterministic PSP Core with Optional AI Advisory and Crypto Rails**

---

## The Release

Payroll Engine v0.1.0 is an open-source, library-first PSP core designed for payroll and regulated money movement.

### Key Properties

- **Append-only, double-entry ledger** with reversal-only corrections
- **Two-gate funding model** ("safe to commit" vs "safe to pay")
- **Replayable domain events** for audit and incident response
- **Liability attribution** and operator-grade runbooks
- **Bank-agnostic payment providers** with optional crypto rails

### Optional AI Advisory

Advisory-only AI for:
- Return analysis and prediction
- Funding risk assessment
- Operational insights
- Runbook assistance

**AI constraints (enforced):**
- Disabled by default
- Explainable decisions
- Confidence-bounded outputs
- Replay-deterministic
- Non-authoritative (cannot move money or override controls)

### What This Is

A library, not a service. Adopters control deployment, databases, and operational policy.
